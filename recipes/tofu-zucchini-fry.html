    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      As a dietitian, stir fries are one of my favourite ways to pack in a ton of nutrients in one pan. This stir fry with zucchini is filled will
      fiber-rich veggies, quality protein, and healthy fats.
    </p>
    <p>Like many of my recipes, this one can easily be modified based on what you have on hands or different veggies/proteins that you enjoy.</p>
    <p>
      I’ve included a bunch of recipe modification ideas for you, as well as tips for cooking zucchini, and ideas for what to serve it with. Enjoy!
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking oil or spray – I love using avocado oil spray for this</li>
      <li>zucchini</li>
      <li>bell pepper</li>
      <li>carrots – feel free to swap carrots + bell peppers for other veggies, like broccoli, mushrooms, snap peas, eggplant, spinach, etc!</li>
      <li>shallot – or you can swap with onion</li>
      <li>garlic</li>
      <li>tofu (firm or extra firm) – if you’d prefer to serve this with another protein, you can use shrimp, chicken, or beef</li>
      <li>toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>soy sauce or tamari</li>
      <li>ginger (ground or fresh)</li>
      <li>rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>cornstarch – or other thickening starch, like arrowroot powder</li>
      <li>optional: green onions (to garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep Tofu:</strong> Drain tofu and wrap with a paper towel. Gently squeeze to remove excess liquid, then place under something heavy
        (like a couple cookbooks) while you prep the veggies and sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cornstarch with 2 teaspoons of water in a small ramekin, until a slurry forms. Then, make the sauce by whisking all sauce ingredients
        (including the cornstarch slurry) in a small bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Unwrap tofu from paper towel and cut into cubes of desired size.</li>
      <li>
        Heat cooking spray in a large pan over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add tofu and season with salt + pepper. Cook for 5 minutes,
        undisturbed. Then flip each piece and cook for an additional 5 minutes, finishing with a quick toss of the pan at the end. Remove and set tofu
        aside in a clean bowl.
      </li>
      <li>In the same pan, cook shallots and garlic for a couple minutes until lightly browned and fragrant</li>
      <li>
        Then, add chopped zucchini, carrots, and bell peppers to the pan. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally. TIP: you can add additional
        cooking oil or spray as needed here.
        <em>Do not salt veggies yet, to prevent zucchini from getting soggy!</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Once veggies are mostly cooked, add tofu back in along with sauce. Toss together and cook for an additional 3 minutes. The sauce should
        thicken slightly and coat everything.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve stir fry on its own or over some cooked grains or noodles (see notes for ideas). Add garnish as desired and season with additional salt
        + pepper, if needed. Enjoy hot!
      </li>
    </ol>
