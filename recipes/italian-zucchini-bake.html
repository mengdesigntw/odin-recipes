    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      This Italian Zucchini Bake is made from scratch with Pecorino Romano and
      Parmesan! It's based on my Mom's zucchini casserole recipe that's a huge
      family favorite. Make it for brunch, parties or a side dish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Folks, you'll want to print out this zucchini recipe for keeps. This is a
      from-scratch version of Mom's zucchini casserole, which she'd adapted from
      the famous Bisquick dish.
    </p>
    <p>It's not like all the rest.</p>
    <p>
      Mom had the brilliant idea years ago to add Pecorino Romano, doubling the
      amount of cheese and providing a nice flavor kick. She also increased the
      oven temperature and baking time to produce a delicious browned crust.
    </p>
    <p>I mean... <em>Hello, Gorgeous!</em></p>
    <p>
      Her version is excellent, and we've requested it over and over for
      dinners, parties and brunches. But I gave up making recipes with baking
      mixes a few years ago. (I avoid partially hydrogenated ingredients when
      possible.) So, when I first started Cooking with Mamma C, I tried using
      "homemade Bisquick" in this cheesy zucchini bake. And...it flopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time, I decided to go with just flour and baking powder to yield
      baking-mix results. It took three more rounds, but I finally did it! I
      wanted to release white smoke from my chimney, like when there's a new
      Pope.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds zucchini (3 medium ones; see notes)</li>
      <li>1 small white onion</li>
      <li>2 medium garlic cloves (pressed or finely chopped)</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil (or vegetable or canola)</li>
      <li>4 eggs (I use extra-large)</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>butter to grease your pan</li>
      <li>fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9x13 glass pan with butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse your zucchini and slice off the tip and root ends. Pat your
        zucchini dry with a paper towel. Leave the skin on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice your zucchini into ⅛-inch rounds, using a mandoline, food
        processor or paring knife. Place your zucchini slices into a large
        mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using paper towels, pat your zucchini slices and gently squeeze them to
        absorb excess moisture. (This is key to prevent a soggy casserole.)
      </li>
      <li>Peel and finely chop your onion and add it to your bowl.</li>
      <li>Add your pressed garlic (or peel and chop it finely).</li>
      <li>
        In a liquid measuring cup, add your oil, then beat in your eggs with a
        fork. Pour the egg/oil mixture into your bowl with the zucchini.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your flour, baking powder, Parmesan, Romano, salt, pepper and basil
        to your bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a wooden spoon to carefully mix everything until combined well. Try
        to separate any zucchini slices that are stuck together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer your zucchini mixture to your greased pan and smooth it out
        evenly. Bake uncovered for 55-60 minutes, or until the entire top is
        browned (but not burned).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the casserole rest for at least five minutes before slicing it.
        Garnish with parsley, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to five days.</li>
    </ol>
