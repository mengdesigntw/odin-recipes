    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Even when it’s warm out, I still prefer cooked meals. I will say though, I don’t enjoy the temperature it makes my home, so when I can, I try to
      focus on quick meals that don’t involve too much cooking. That can encompass any of my favorites like my easy balsamic tofu or curried red bean
      skillet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, quick cooking also comes in handy anytime of year as far as I’m concerned. There are days when I don’t really want to mess around too much
      in the kitchen, so recipes like these Chipotle Orange Chickpeas come in handy.
